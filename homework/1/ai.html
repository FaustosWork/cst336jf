                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is probably one of the best yet scariest innovations mankind has invented.
                   AI brings get help from something other than a human to solve problems or to simply help us.
                   From theory to reality, AI is being used for simple programs, but it will later drift into the 
                   hands of a real functioning robot. Sophia, the first humanoid robot, is the epitome of what the future
                   has waiting for us.

                <p>Artificial Intelligence is basically making a computer literally do work for us. It gives permission for 
                machines to learn by experience to be able to adapt to certain issues such as playing a board game with a human user
                or a self-driving car moving around a major city. The benefits to using AI is to essentially solve problems that humans
                can't solve. However, the main controversy surrounding Artificial Intelligence
                is the fact that because it constantly adapts to new issues, it can one day take over.
