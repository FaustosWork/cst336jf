                   Everyone has seen Iron Man at one point or another. If you haven't, you should definitely 
                   check it out since it may give a very large spoiler of what the future can have. The ARC reactor, the 
                   device that gave Iron Man the ability to continue staying alive despite shrapnel being severly close to his heart 
                   is an example of something that can be achieved with Nano-Computing.

                    Nano-Computing is when the actual dimensions of a computer are small enough to only be seen 
                    through a microscope. Like Iron Man's Arc Reactor, there are several beneficial ideas and types of Nano-Computers
                    that we can see developed within the next couple of years. One popular idea is 
                    swallowing a pill that contains a nano-computer with the idea that if you're sick,
                    the nano-computer will be able to find and eliminate the illness by telling the user what is wrong and 
                    how to fix it. This will only be truly possible with Computer Science's beast: the Quantum Computer.
