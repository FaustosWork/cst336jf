                <p>Quantum Computing is the building block to all the topics mentioned. Without it, there
                   would be no efficient AI or nano-computers. Complex and diificult tasks performed on a quantum 
                   computers would be solved with more ease and performance. With all this hype surrounding Quantum
                   Computing, the real question is what is it and why do we need it.</p>
                <p>In a nutshell, Quantum Computing is using what we know in physics infused with what we know in 
                   computer science. Basically, you'll be getting the best of both world with one of these bad boys.
                   We need Quantum Computing because according to IBM, our puny computers 
                   do not have enough power to stand a chance against the world's most complex problems.
                   That is where Quantum Computing comes in. The power of a quantum computer
                   grows and adapts to the issue at hand. Imagine fighting someone who you can beat, but 
                   all of a sudden they eat some spinach and grow stronger and faster than you. Yes,
                   that was a Popeye reference, but you get the point. Quantum Computing is the way of the future.</p>
